Q2. Consider a string, S, that is a series of characters, each followed by its frequency as an integer. 
The string is not compressed correctly, so there may be multiple occurrences of the same character. 
A properly compressed string will consist of one instance of each character in alphabetical order followed by the total 
count of that character within the string.

Q8. For each element of an array of non-negative integers, arrin], is calculated as:
prefli] = arr[1JIJ⊕ arrl2JIJO . . . ⊕arrli]
Here x ⊕ y is the bitwise XOR of x and y. The array pref[n] contains the prefix XOR of all elements in arr[n]where 1 s is n.
1
2
Given the array pref, find the original array arr.
Note: There is always a unique arr for a given pref.
