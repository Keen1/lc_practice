/*
* Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:
* Symbols   Value
* I         1
* V         5
* X         10
* L         50
* C         100
* D         500
* M         1000
* Roman numerals are written largest to smallest from left to right.
* There are six instances where subtraction are used, for instance:
* when representing 4, it is written IV, not IIII. Thus we subtract 1 from 5 and get for.
* I can be placed before V and X to make 4 and 9
* X can be placed before L and C to make 40 and 90
* C can be placed before D and M to make 400 and 900
*
* Given a roman numeral as a string, convert it to an integer.
