binary tree in order traversal
define in order traversal --
The inorder traversal of a binary tree is a method of visiting all the nodes in the tree in a specific order. The process follows these steps:

    Traverse the left subtree.
    Visit the root node.
    Traverse the right subtree.

In other words, for each node in the tree, the left subtree is visited first, then the node itself is processed, and finally, the right subtree is visited.

This results in the nodes being visited in non-decreasing order if the binary tree is a binary search tree.
